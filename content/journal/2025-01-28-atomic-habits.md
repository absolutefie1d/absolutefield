I used to set big goals and burn out. This book shifted my focus to systems instead. Small daily actions compound into something bigger than any single ambitious target.

## The Key Insight

It's not about the goal, it's about the system. Anyone can set a goal to read 30 books. But building a system where you read for 20 minutes before bed every night? That's what actually gets you there.

## How I'm Applying It

1. **Piano**: I don't aim to "get good at piano" — I sit down at 7pm every day for 30 minutes
2. **Fitness**: I don't aim to "get fit" — I put on workout clothes every MWF morning at 6am
3. **Reading**: I don't aim to "read more" — I read one chapter before sleep, no exceptions

## The 1% Rule

Getting 1% better every day sounds small. But compounded over a year, that's 37x improvement. I'm not trying to be dramatically better tomorrow. Just slightly better than yesterday.

The book isn't revolutionary in its ideas, but it packages them in a way that finally clicked for me.
