I never thought I'd be a morning person. But there's something about finishing a workout before 7 AM that sets the tone for everything else.

## The Shift

For years I tried to work out in the evenings. And for years, "something came up" almost every day. Work ran late. I was tired. Dinner plans. A show I wanted to watch. The excuses were endless and all felt valid.

Then I tried mornings. Just once, to see. And I hated it. The alarm was painful. The workout felt sluggish. I was grumpy.

But then 8 AM hit and I had already accomplished something. The rest of the day felt like bonus time.

## What Changed

- **No decision fatigue** - I work out before my brain wakes up enough to negotiate
- **Consistent energy** - Evening energy varies; morning energy is predictably low (but manageable)
- **Protected time** - Nothing interrupts a 6 AM workout. The world is still asleep.

## My Current Routine

- 5:45 AM - Alarm (no snooze allowed)
- 5:50 AM - Workout clothes already laid out
- 6:00 AM - Start workout (strength MWF, cardio TTH)
- 6:45 AM - Done, shower, feel like a champion

It's not about being a morning person. It's about being a person who gets things done before life gets in the way.
