Looking back at my first month learning piano, I'm surprised by how much muscle memory matters. The chord transitions that felt impossible in week one are now becoming second nature.

## What Worked

- **Daily practice over long sessions** - 30 minutes every day beats 2 hours twice a week
- **Starting with worship songs I love** - Motivation stays high when you enjoy what you're playing
- **Using a metronome** - Humbling at first, but my timing has improved dramatically

## What I'm Still Working On

- Inversions still trip me up, especially moving from G to C smoothly
- Playing and singing at the same time feels impossible right now
- My left hand wants to do exactly what my right hand does

## Next Month's Focus

I want to nail the I-IV-V-vi progression in at least 3 keys without looking at my hands. Also planning to learn "Build My Life" as my first slightly more complex song.

Here's to month two! 🎹
